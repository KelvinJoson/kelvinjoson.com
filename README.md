> (3) Let love and faithfulnessÂ never leave you;
> bind them around your neck, write them on the tablet of your heart.
> (4) Then you will win favor and a good name in the sight of God and man.
> (5) Trust in theÂ LordÂ with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding;
> (6) in all your ways submit to him, and he will make your pathsÂ straight.
